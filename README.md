## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sasscss.org/) - Website

### What I learned

I mainly learned about accessibility and how to implement certain features, as well as how to handle SVG files more effectively.

### Continued development

In future projects, I still want to work more with SVG files and also study accessibility further.

### Useful resources
